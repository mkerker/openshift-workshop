## Lab 11: Application promotion across environments

In this lab we will learn how an application image binary can be promoted across the environments. As an example we will use development and test environments, a promotion to pre-prod and production will be very similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of environments (development, test, production).

**Step 1: Create two projects**

Using the knowledge you gained from the past create two projects: **dev** and **test**

**Step 2: Provide ImagePuller access to the test project from Development Project**

The following command will allow the _test_ project to be able to pull the docker images from the _dev_ project.

```
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:test -n dev
```

**Step 3: Create an application in the development project**

Switch over to the **dev** project and deploy an application from google docker hub. You can use webconsole or command line. The command line option is shown below.

```
$ oc project dev
$ oc new-app google/ruby-hello -l name=myapp
```

**Step 4: Tag the docker image**

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application. OpenShift will create an image stream for the image as well as deploy and manage containers based on that image.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. "is" is the short form for imagestream. 

```
$ oc get is
NAME     DOCKER REPO                                     TAGS      UPDATED
myapp    172.30.47.239:5000/dev/myapp   latest    12 seconds ago

```

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id:

```
$ oc describe is myapp
<output>
172.30.226.0:5000/dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4
```

In this case, the full image Id is `172.30.226.0:5000/dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4`

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote to test. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is
`
oc tag FullImageId dev/myapp:promote-test
`

Check the following commands and replace the values as your needs:

```
$ oc tag dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4 dev/myapp:promote-test
```

```
$ oc describe is myapp

```

**Step 5: Deploy (PULL) the application to test**

Now you can switch over to the test project and deploy the docker image that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for this project and

```
$ oc project test

$ oc new-app dev/myapp:promote-test

$ oc expose service myapp
```

Test this application in the test project. Note that we deployed the docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code.

Congratulations!! 
You now know how to promote your application across environments in OpenShift.
