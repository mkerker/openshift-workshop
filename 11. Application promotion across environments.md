## Lab 11: Application promotion across environments

In this lab we will learn how an application image binary can be promoted across the environments. As an example we will use development and test environments, a promotion to pre-prod and production will be very similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of environments (development, test, production).

**Step 1: Create two projects**

Create a new project with name “dev” and providing “edit” access to developer and “view” access to the tester.

```
$ oc new-project dev —display-name="Development Project"
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit dev1
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view test1
```
Create a test project and provide “edit’ access to the tester.

```
$ oc new-project test —display-name="Test Project"
$ oc policy add-role-to-user edit test1
```

**Step 2: Provide ImagePuller access to the test project from Development Project**

Assigning the system:image-puller role to the service account “test” which is the default service account for the test project on the dev project. By doing this, we are enabling the test project to be able to pull images from the dev project.

```
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:test -n dev
```

**Step 3: Create an application in the development project**

First login as dev1 user:

```
$ oc login -u dev1 -p <anypassword>
```
Switch over to the **dev** project and deploy an application from google docker hub. You can use webconsole or command line. The command line option is shown below.

```
$ oc project dev
$ oc new-app google/ruby-hello -l name=myapp
```

**Step 4: Tag the docker image**

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application. OpenShift will create an image stream for the image as well as deploy and manage containers based on that image.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. "is" is the short form for imagestream. 

```
$ oc get is
NAME     DOCKER REPO                                     TAGS      UPDATED
myapp    172.30.47.239:5000/dev/myapp   latest    12 seconds ago

```

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id:

```
$ oc describe is myapp
<output>

...
...

172.30.226.0:5000/dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4
```

In this case, the full image Id is `172.30.226.0:5000/dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4`

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote to test. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is
`
oc tag FullImageId dev/myapp:promote-test
`

Check the following commands and replace the values as your needs:

```
$ oc tag dev/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4 dev/myapp:promote-test
```

```
$ oc describe is myapp

```

**Step 5: Deploy (PULL) the application to test**

Now you can switch over to the test project and deploy the docker image that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for this project and ogin as dev1 user:

```
$ oc login -u test1 -p <anypassword>

$ oc project test

$ oc new-app dev/myapp:promote-test

$ oc expose service myapp
```

Test this application in the test project. Note that we deployed the docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code.

Congratulations!! 
You now know how to promote your application across environments in OpenShift.
