## Lab 6: Blue-Green Deployment

The purpose of this short lab is to demonstrate how simple it is to implement Blue-Green Deployments in OpenShift.

"*Blue-green deployment is a release strategy that can be utilized by developers
for deploying software in a production environment. Blue can be one particular
production environment whereas green can define an identical production
environment. Under blue-green deployment strategy, software developers are able
to minimize downtime and reduce risk.*" [Link*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nuqing/Blue-green_deployment)

Blue-green deployments involve running two versions of an application at the same time and moving production traffic from the old version to the new version. There are several ways to implement a blue-green deployment in OpenShift Container Platform.

We use a blue-green deployment when you want to test a new version of your application in a production environment before moving traffic to it.

> Blue-green deployments make switching between two different versions of your application easy. However, since many applications depend on persistent data, you will need to have an application that supports N-1 compatibility if you share a database, or implement a live data migration between your database, store, or disk if you choose to create two copies of your data layer.

#### Step 1: Blue-Green Deployment Example

Create a project called `bluegreen`.

```
$ oc new-project bluegreen --display-name="Blue Green Project" --description="Blue Green Project"
```

In order to maintain control over two distinct groups of instances (old and new versions of the code), the blue-green deployment is best represented with multiple deployment configurations.

A route points to a service, and can be changed to point to a different service at any time. As a developer, test the new version of your code by connecting to the new service before your production traffic is routed to it. Routes are intended for web (HTTP and HTTPS) traffic, so this technique is best suited for web applications.

#### Step 2: Create two example applications

Create two copies of the example applicatio.

An application based on v1 (blue) called app-v1
```
$ oc new-app mkerker/deployment-example:v1 --name=app-v1
```
And an application based on v2 (blue) called app-v2
```
$ oc new-app mkerker/deployment-example:v2 --name=app-v2
```

This will create two independent application components: one running the v1 image under the green service, and one using the v2 image under the blue service.

Now two versions of the application are running parallel in identical an environent.

Create a route that points to the old service:
```
$ oc get service

<.output


$ oc expose service app-v1 --name=app
```
See route:
```
$ oc get route
<outpu>
```
Browse to the application at app.bluegreen.192.168.99.100. to verify you see the v1 image.

#### Step 3: Change service to application version 2

Edit the previously created route and change the `service` name from `app-v1` **blue** to `app-v2` **green**, all the way at the bottom to the new service that was just created. You are essentially still using the FQDN you had previously created. However, that route will now point to a different (green) service.

```
$ oc edit route bluegreen
```
In your browser, refresh the page until you see the v2 image.

#### Step 4: Back to version 1

An alternative way to do modifications of a resource is with the `oc patch` command:

```
$ oc patch route/bluegreen -p '{"spec":{"to":{"name":"app-v1"}}}'
```
Try it to go back to application v1 !!!!


## Summary

- Blue-Green deployments can be easily accomplished in OpenShift.

- We have shown multiple versions of an application; all running concurrently, each with a unique service.

- All that is needed to expose any of the applications is to change the service being used by the route to publicly advertise the application.
