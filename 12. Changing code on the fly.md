## Lab 12: Changing code on the fly

In this lab, we will learn how to make changes to the code on the local machine and immediately sync it with the code running in a pod.

**Note:** This model of programming is useful for interpreted languages.

**Step 1: Create a new project**	   
Create a new project on the OpenShift cluster with name `rsynccode`. 

**Step 2: Download the node-hello application locally**
Download the node-hello application from the following git repository to your workstation.
[https://github.com/mkerker/nodejs-hello](https://github.com/mkerker/nodejs-hello)
Unzip it with an unzip tool in a directory of choise.

This is a very simple nodejs application. Feel free to understand the code.

**Step 3: Create the application**

Change to the `nodejs-hello-master` folder.

```
$ cd nodejs-hello-master
```

Now let us create an application using this code.  	

```
$ oc new-app .
<output>

```

After that, create a route

```
$ oc expose service nodejs-hello
route "nodejs-hello" exposed
```
Wait for the build to complete and test the application

```
$ oc get route
NAME           HOST/PORT                                          PATH           SERVICES       PORT       TERMINATION
nodejs-hello   nodejs-hello.rsynccode.....                        nodejs-hello   8080-tcp
```

```
$ curl nodejs-hello.rsynccode.....
Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
```

**Step 4: Make code changes and sync with rsync**

Let us now make a small change to the application on your workstation.

Edit `server.js` file using your favorite text editor (I use vi). The code snippet below displays the welcome message

```
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Welcome to OpenShift!! My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
```

Let us make a small change of `'Welcome to OpenShift`. The edited code should look like this.

```
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('I hope u have enjoy this course !! \n My HostName is: ' + os.hostname() + '\n');
});
```

Run `oc get pods` to get your application pod name as shown below:
```
$ oc get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
nodejs-hello-1-8qigc   1/1       Running     0          8m
nodejs-hello-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          9m
```

Use `oc rsync` to sync the code from the local workstation to the **Running** pod as shown below

```
$ oc rsync . nodejs-hello-1-8qigc:/opt/app-root/src --no-perms=true 
building file list ... done

sent 89 bytes  received 20 bytes  2.29 bytes/sec
total size is 805  speedup is 7.39
```

The command above will copy the code from the local machine to the pod. Note that    
* `/opt/app-root/src` is the default home location on the pod    

Now test the application again. This time it should show the output in two lines as below:

```
$ curl nodejs-hello.rsynccode.....
I hope u have enjoy this course !!
My HostName is: nodejs-hello-1-8qigc
```

Note that pod did not restart, we did not have to check into git repo and rebuild the image. The changes moved from your workstation directly to the pod.

Developers can use this mechanism to quickly test the changes on the fly. When ready they can commit the changes to the source control repository.

You can repeat a few more changes and enjoy the rsync!!!
