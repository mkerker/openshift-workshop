## Lab 1: Create an App from a Docker image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to create an application from an existing docker image.

**Step 1: Add a new project from command line**

```
$ oc new-project mycliproject --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"
```
Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following command:

````
$ oc get projects
````
If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you don't want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

```
$ oc status

In project CLI Project (mycliproject)

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
```

**Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image**

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on dockerhub that just says "Hello OpenShift !!". Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the `oc new-app` command as shown below:

```
$ oc new-app openshift/hello-openshift --name=hello
--> Found Docker image 212605b (About an hour old) from Docker Hub for "openshift/hello-openshift"

    * An image stream will be created as "hello:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "hello"
    * Ports 8080/tcp, 8888/tcp will be load balanced by service "hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "hello"
    * WARNING: Image "openshift/hello-openshift" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream "hello" created
    deploymentconfig "hello" created
    service "hello" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```
The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

```
$ oc get pods
NAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
hello-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
```
In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

```
$ oc get pods
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1-fbw7e   1/1       Running   0          10s
```

**Step 3: Add a Route for your application**

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following command to view the list of services in the project.

```
$ oc get services
NAME      CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
hello     172.30.143.150   <none>        8080/TCP,8888/TCP   1m
```

You will notice the `hello` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it from the browser.

**Note**: In this example, the default domain name is something like this: `.192.168.99.100.xip.io` !!!!!

```
$ oc expose service hello --name=hello 
<output>
```

To see the route and the FQDN.
```
$ oc get routes
<output>

```

**Step 4: Try your application**

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

```
$ curl http://hello-mycliproject.192.168.99.100.xip.io
```

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker image on OpenShift.

**Step 4: Clean up**

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in your project.

```
$ oc get all

<output>
````

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

````
$ oc delete all --all

<output>

````
You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!
