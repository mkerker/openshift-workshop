## Lab 1: Create your first app from a Docker image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to create an application from an existing docker image.

#### Step 0: Login to our environment

The first step we must make is to logon with a user, we can use a own thoise 

```
$ oc login -u <yourname> -p <anypassword>
```

**Step 1: Add a new project from command line**

Create a new project called _myfirstapp_
```
$ oc new-project myfirstapp --description="My First App" --display-name="My First App"
Now using project "myfirstapp" on server "https://192.168.99.100:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
```
Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following command:

```
$ oc get projects
NAME         DISPLAY NAME   STATUS
myfirstapp   My First App   Active
myproject    My Project     Active
```
If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you don't want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

```
$ oc status
In project My First App (myfirstapp) on server https://192.168.99.100:8443

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
```

**Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image**

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on dockerhub that just says "Hello OpenShift !!". Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the `oc new-app` command as shown below:

```
$ oc new-app mkerker/hello-openshift --name=hello
--> Found Docker image 6413130 (3 days old) from Docker Hub for "mkerker/hello-openshift"

    * An image stream will be created as "hello:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "hello"
    * Ports 8080/tcp, 8888/tcp will be load balanced by service "hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "hello"
    * WARNING: Image "mkerker/hello-openshift" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream "hello" created
    deploymentconfig "hello" created
    service "hello" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```
The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod. If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

```
$ oc get pods
NAME             READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1-deploy   1/1       Running             0          3s
hello-1-yb8jp    0/1       ContainerCreating   0          1s
```
In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

```
$ oc get pods
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1-yb8jp   1/1       Running   0          29s
```

**Step 3: Add a Route for your application**

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following command to view the list of services in the project.

```
$ oc get services
NAME      CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
hello     172.30.104.233   <none>        8080/TCP,8888/TCP   1m
```

You will notice the `hello` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it from the browser.

**Note**: In this example, the default domain name is something like this: `.192.168.99.100.xip.io` !!!!!

```
$ oc expose service hello --name=hello 
route "hello" exposed
```

To see the route and the FQDN.
```
$ oc get routes
NAME      HOST/PORT                                PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
hello     hello-myfirstapp.192.168.99.100.xip.io             hello      8080-tcp
```

**Step 4: Try your application**

Access the application: Now access the application using curl (looking for 200 status code) or from the browser and see the result

```
$ curl -L http://hello-myfirstapp.192.168.99.100.xip.io
```

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker image on OpenShift.

**Step 4: Clean up**

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in your project.

```
$ oc get all
NAME       DOCKER REPO                           TAGS      UPDATED
is/hello   172.30.36.239:5000/myfirstapp/hello   latest    6 minutes ago

NAME       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
dc/hello   1          1         1         config,image(hello:latest)

NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rc/hello-1   1         1         1         6m

NAME           HOST/PORT                                PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
routes/hello   hello-myfirstapp.192.168.99.100.xip.io             hello      8080-tcp

NAME        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
svc/hello   172.30.104.233   <none>        8080/TCP,8888/TCP   6m

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/hello-1-yb8jp   1/1       Running   0          6m
```

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

```
$ oc delete all --all
imagestream "hello" deleted
deploymentconfig "hello" deleted
route "hello" deleted
service "hello" deleted
pod "hello-1-yb8jp" deleted
```
You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!
