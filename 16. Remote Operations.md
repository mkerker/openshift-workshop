## Lab: Remote Operations

#### Background

Containers are treated as immutable infrastructure and therefore it is generally not recommended to modify the content of a container through SSH or running custom commands inside the container. Nevertheless, in some use-cases, such as debugging an application, it might be beneficial to get into a container and inspect the application.

#### Step 1: Remote shell session to a container

OpenShift allows establishing remote shell sessions to a container without the need to run an SSH service inside each container. In order to establish an interactive session inside a container, you can use the oc rsh command. First get the list of available pods:

Go first to project `mycliproject` and then list de pods

```
$ oc get pods
NAME           READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
time-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1m
time-1-rqa7c   1/1       Running     0          1m
```
Now you can establish a remote shell session into the pod by using the pod name with the `oc rsh` command.

```
$ oc rsh time-1-rqa7c
sh-4.2$
```

The default shell used by oc rsh is /bin/sh. If the deployed container does not have sh installed and uses another shell, (e.g. A Shell) the shell command can be specified after the pod name in the issued command.

Run the following command to list the files in the top folder:
```
$ ls /

<output>
```
Exit the container:
```
$ exit
```
#### Step 2: Execute a command in a container

In addition to remote shell, it is also possible to run a command remotely in an already running container using the oc exec command. This does not require that a shell is installed, but only that the desired command is present and in the executable path.

For security purposes, the ```oc exec``` command does not work when accessing privileged containers. 

**Basic Usage**
Support for remote container command execution is built into the CLI:
```
$ oc exec <pod> [-c <container>] <command> [<arg_1> ... <arg_n>]
```
In order to show the date, run the following:
```
$ oc exec time-1-rqa7c -- date
Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2017
```
The -- syntax in the oc exec command delineates where execâ€™s options end and where the actual command to execute begins. Take a look at oc exec --help for more details.

You can also specify the shell commands to run directly with the oc rsh command:
```
$ oc rsh parksmap-2-tegp4 whoami
whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1000060000
error: error executing remote command: error executing command in container: Error executing in Docker Container: 1
```

__It is important to understand that, for security reasons, OpenShift does not run Docker containers as the user specified in the Dockerfile by default. In fact, when OpenShift launches a container its user is actually randomized.__

#### Step 3: Use the web console

You can also access a terminal into a container from the web console. On the Pod details page, one of the tabs says Terminal. 

**Try it!**
