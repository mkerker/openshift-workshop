## Lab: Remote Operations

#### Background

Containers are treated as immutable infrastructure and therefore it is generally not recommended to modify the content of a container through SSH or running custom commands inside the container. Nevertheless, in some use-cases, such as debugging an application, it might be beneficial to get into a container and inspect the application.

#### Step 1: Remote shell session to a container

OpenShift allows establishing remote shell sessions to a container without the need to run an SSH service inside each container. In order to establish an interactive session inside a container, you can use the oc rsh command. First get the list of available pods:

----
$ oc get pods
<output>
----
Now you can establish a remote shell session into the pod by using the pod name with the  oc rsh command 


$ oc rsh parksmap-2-tegp4
sh-4.2$


The default shell used by oc rsh is /bin/sh. If the deployed container does not have sh installed and uses another shell, (e.g. A Shell) the shell command can be specified after the pod name in the issued command.

Run the following command to list the files in the top folder:

$ ls /

<output>

Exit the container:

$ exit

#### Step 2: Execute a command in a container

In addition to remote shell, it is also possible to run a command remotely in an already running container using the oc exec command. This does not require that a shell is installed, but only that the desired command is present and in the executable path.

In order to show just the JAR file, run the following:

$ oc exec parksmap-2-tegp4 -- ls -l /parksmap.jar

-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 21753918 Nov 23 15:54 /parksmap.jar
The -- syntax in the oc exec command delineates where exec’s options end and where the actual command to execute begins. Take a look at oc exec --help for more details.

You can also specify the shell commands to run directly with the oc rsh command:

$ oc rsh parksmap-2-tegp4 whoami
whoami: cannot find name for user ID 1000060000
error: error executing remote command: error executing command in container: Error executing in Docker Container: 1

It is important to understand that, for security reasons, OpenShift does not run Docker containers as the user specified in the Dockerfile by default. In fact, when OpenShift launches a container its user is actually randomized.

#### Step 3: Use the web console

You can also access a terminal into a container from the web console. On the Pod details page, one of the tabs says Terminal.
