## Lab 8: Rollback Applications (A/B Deployment).

In this lab we will see how we can rollback an application in OpenShift quickly without switching to an older version of the source code.

In this Lab we will:

- Use the same app we deployed in lab 7. If you haven't, please complete lab 7 first.

- Rollback the application using the OpenShift command "rollback".

**Step 1: Check application health status**

List the running pods.

```
$ oc get pods

<output>
```

Inspecting the output of the above command we can see that we have a single replica of the previously deployed application running.

We can also see that previously two pods were used to build the application. OpenShift will create and docker deploy a pod per deployment. This tells us that we currently have two versions of the application.
You can also use the deploymenConfig(dc):

```
$ oc get dc 
$ oc get dc/myapp
<output>

$ oc describe dc/myapp
```
The latest and active version for the application is **v2**
If we display the application in the browser we see:

![image] !!!!!

**Step 2: Rollback the application**

Let's show the histroy of the application

```
oc rollout history dc/myapp
```

Using the previous command we ran to retrieve the deployment configuration, we will revert or rollback to version 1.

```
$ oc rollback [dc] --to-version=1
$ oc rollout undo dc/app-v2

```

If we re-run the command to list the build configurations, we now see:

```
$ oc get dc
<outp>
```
Or look at the history again.

```
oc rollout history dc/myapp
```


So OpenShift has rolled back the application to version 1 and created a new build configuration.
Reloading the application now displays:

![image] !!!!
