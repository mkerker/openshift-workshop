## Lab 12: Using SSL in your application

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

**Step 1: Switch to an existing project**

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We will be using the {{{ander project !!}}} that you created in the previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the **oc project** command.

```
$ oc new-app google/nodejs-hello
```
```
$ oc project hello-
```

**Step 2: View the routing config**

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route` command

```
$ oc get route/ks -o yaml

<output>
```

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift supports ports `80` and `443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in order to get the `443` mapping to work.

**Step 3: TLS Edge Termination**

OpenShift has a *wildcard* SSL certificate that it can use for any application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

```
oc edit route/ks
```

You are going to add `tls: termination: edge` right below the `host:` section. It should look something like this.

```
<output> met **host:**
```

**Step 4: Verify**

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://xxxxx.<<DomainNameSuffix>>` URI


Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL from your application
