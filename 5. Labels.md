## Lab 5: Labels
This is a pretty simple lab, we are going to explore labels. You can use labels to organize, group, or select API objects.

For example, pods are “tagged” with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different Docker containers as related entities.

**Step 1: Labels a on pod**

> In a previous lab we added our web app using a template. When we did that, OpenShift labeled our objects for us. Let’s look at the labels on our running pod.

Firtsd make sure, that u use the `showtime` project.

```
$ oc project
```

than try the following:
```
$ oc get pods
NAME           READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
time-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          5h
time-1-der6m   1/1       Running     0          5h


$ oc describe pod/time-1-der6m
```
You can see the Labels automatically added contain the app, deployment, and deploymentconfig. Let's add a new label to this pod.

**Step 2: Add a label**

After that, lets add a label to the app.
```
$ oc label pod/time-1-der6m testdate=27.06.2017 testedby=mylastname
```

**Step 3: Look at the labels**

```
$ oc describe pod/time-1-der6m| more
```

**Summary**

That’s it for this lab, now you know that all the objects in OpenShift can be labeled. This is important because those labels can be used as part of your deployment process. The next labs will cover using labels for BlueGreen, A/B deployments and running yours apps on specific nodes.
