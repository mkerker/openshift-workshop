## Code Promotion across Environments

In this lab we will learn how an application image binary can be promoted across the environments. As an example we will use development and QA environments as promotion to pre-prod and production will be very similar.

In this example we are using projects as means of separation of environments (development, qa, production).

**Step 1: Create two projects**

Using the knowledge you gained from the past create two projects. 

**Step 2: Provide ImagePuller Access to the QA Project from Development Project**

The following command will allow the QA project to be able to pull the docker images from the Development project.

````
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing -n development
````

**Step 3: Create an application in the development project**

Switch over to the **development** project and deploy an application using `eap6-basic-sti` template. You can use webconsole or command line. The command line option is shown below.

````
oc project development
oc new-app --template=eap64-basic-s2i -p APPLICATION_NAME=myapp -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/kitchensink.git -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF="" -p CONTEXT_DIR="" -l name=myapp
````

**Step 4: Tag the docker image**

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Now if you check the imagestreams you will find the docker image for this application.

Now find the imagestream name using the following command. "is" is the short form for imagestream.

````
$ oc get is
NAME     DOCKER REPO                                     TAGS      UPDATED
myapp    172.30.47.239:5000/development-UserName/myapp   latest    12 seconds ago

````

Now describe this image stream to get the full image id:

````
$ oc describe is myapp
Name:				myapp
Created:			13 minutes ago
Labels:				application=myapp,name=myapp,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
					openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=tag "latest" has not been set on 					repository "development/myapp"
Docker Pull Spec:	172.30.226.0:5000/development/myapp

Tag	Spec		Created		PullSpec														Image
latest	<pushed>	9 minutes ago	172.30.226.0:5000/development-/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4
````

In this case, the full image Id is `172.30.226.0:5000/development-/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4`

Now let us assume that this docker image is good and is ready to promote to QA. Let us tag this docker image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is

````
oc tag FullImageId development/myapp:promote-qa
````

Check the following commands and replace the values as your needs:

```
oc tag development/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4 development/myapp:promote-qa

oc describe is myapp

Name:				myapp
Created:			16 minutes ago
Labels:				application=myapp,name=myapp,template=eap64-basic-s2i,xpaas=1.1.0
Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
					openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=tag "latest" has not been set on repository "development/myapp"
Docker Pull Spec:	172.30.226.0:5000/development/myapp

Tag		Spec										Created		PullSpec											Image
latest		<pushed>									12 minutes ago	172.30.226.0:5000/development/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4
promote-qa	myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4	58 seconds ago	172.30.226.0:5000/development/myapp@sha256:7d0a5e0bbb0be497db86e2cac4f3ba47b5a6fa0d1a4e1529724ec1b21042e1f4

```

**Step 5: Deploy the application to QA**

Now you can switch over to the QA project and deploy the docker image that we tagged in development. Also expose service to create route for this project and

````
oc project testing
oc new-app development/myapp:promote-qa
oc expose service myapp
````

Test this application in the QA project. Note that we deployed the docker image from the development project without rebuilding the code.

Congratulations!! you now know how to promote your application across environments in OpenShift 3.
