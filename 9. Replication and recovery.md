## Lab 9: Replication and recovery.
Things will go wrong, and that’s why we have replication and recovery. Things will go wrong with your software, or your hardware, or from something out of your control. But we can plan for that failure, and planning for it let’s us minimize the impact. OpenShift supports this via what we call replication and recovery.


**Step 1: Switch to an existing project**

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We will be using the `mycliproject` that you created in the previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the `oc project` command.

```
$ oc project mycliproject
```


**Step 2: Replication**

Let’s walk through a simple example of how the replication controller can keep your deployment at a desired state. Assuming you still have the `time` project running we can manually scale up our replicas to handle increased user load.

```
$ oc scale --replicas=4 dc/time
```
 Check out the new pods:
```
$ oc get pods
```

Notice that you now have 4 unique pods availble to inspect. If you want go ahead and inspect them you can see that each have their own IP address and logs (oc describe).

So you’ve told OpenShift that you’d like to maintain 4 running, load-balanced, instances of our `time` app.

**Step 3: Recovery**

OK, now that we have a slightly more interesting desired replication state, we can test a service outages scenario. In this scenario, the `time` replication controller will ensure that other pods are created to replace those that become unhealthy. Let’s force inflict an issue and see how OpenShift reponds.

Choose a random pod and delete it, where {PODNAM} is the podname of the command: ``oc get pods``.
```
$ oc get pods
$ oc delete pod/{PODNAME}
$ oc get pods -w
```
If you're fast enough you'll see the pod you deleted go "Terminating" and you'll also see a new pod immediately get created and from "Pending" to "Running". If you weren't fast enough you can see that your old pod is gone and a new pod is in the list with an age of only a few seconds. 

You can see the more details about your replication controller with: 
```
$ oc describe rc
```
**Step 4: Application Health**

In addition to the health of your application’s pods, OpenShift will watch the containers inside those pods. Let’s force inflict some issues and see how OpenShift reponds.

Choose a running pod and shell into it:
```
$ oc get pods
$ oc exec {PODNAME} -it /bin/bash
```
You are now executing a bash shell running in the container of the pod. Let's kill our webapp and see what happens. 
If we had multiple containers in the pod we could use "-c CONTAINER_NAME" to select the right one 

Choose a running pod and shell into its container:
```
$ pkill -9 node
```
This will kick you out off the container with an error like "Error executing command in container" 

Do it again - shell in and execute the same command to kill node.
Watch for the container restart.
```
$ oc get pods -w
```
If a container dies multiple times quickly, OpenShift is going to put the pod in a CrashBackOff state. This ensures the system doesn't waste resources trying to restart containers that are continuously crashing.

**Step 5: Clean up**

Let’s scale back down to 1 replica. If you are using the web console just click the down arrow from the Overview page. If you are using the command line use the “oc scale” command.

**Summary**

In this lab we learned about replication controllers and how they can be used to scale your applications and services. We also tried to break a few things and saw how OpenShift responded to heal the system and keep it running. This topic can get deeper than we’ve experimented with here, but getting deeper into application health and recovery is an advanced topic.
